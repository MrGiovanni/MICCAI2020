* [x] Joint Modeling of Chest Radiographs and Radiology Reports for Pulmonary Edema Assessment - Chauhan, Geeticka; Liao, Ruizhi; Wells III, William M.; Andreas, Jacob; Wang, Xin; Berkowitz, Seth; Horng, Steven; Szolovits, Peter; Golland, Polina, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

This paper aims to classify three labels from chest radiographs and their reports. The input consists of a pair of image and text report. They joint train an imaging encoder and a text encoder (BERT) and in the inference, they only take the trained imaging encoder. Experiments show better performance achieved by joint training than isolated training.
